# Java Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Java, where two players can compete on a 3x3 grid. The project aims to showcase basic concepts of graphical interface, events, game logic, and score tracking.

## Implemented Features

1. **Graphical Interface:** Uses the Swing library to create a user-friendly and interactive graphical interface for the game.

2. **Alternate Players:** "X" and "O" players alternate their moves automatically.

3. **Turn Message:** Displays which player's turn it is to make a move.

4. **Victory Detection:** Automatically checks if any player has won by completing a row, column, or diagonal.

5. **Draw Message:** Displays a message and restarts the game if no more moves are available.

6. **Score Tracking:** Keeps track of players' scores during matches.

7. **Game Reset:** Allows resetting the game after a match is concluded.

## How to Play

1. Run the Java program to start the game.

2. Click on empty cells to make your moves alternately as "X" and "O".

3. The game will indicate each player's turn and automatically check for a win.

4. If no one wins and all cells are filled, the game will be declared a draw.

5. Each player's score is updated with each win and draw.

6. Click the "Reset" ("LetÂ´s play again!") button to start a new game.
